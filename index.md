## About me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg" onmouseover="this.src='coco_headphone.jpg';" onmouseout="this.src='profile.jpg';">

Hi! I'm a PhD student in the [CDT in Natural language processing](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing) at the University of Edinburgh, where I work with [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/) and [Hao Tang](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/htang2/), and collaborate with [Naomi Feldman](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/index.html). 

In my research, I study *how* self-supervised speech representations encode information about [speaker](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12464.pdf) or about [context (neighboring phones)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08237). More generally, I want to understand how humans and models acquire and process language. 

Email me (oli.liu) here: ed.ac.uk to talk about my research or Edinburgh or speech or NLP or cognitive science :) 

### News

September 2024 - I've been fortunate to attend Cogsci in Rotterdam ([talk](Cogsci_talk.pdf)), and Interspeech in Kos ([poster](interspeech_poster.pdf)) this past summer. Now I'm ready to stay away from making posters and writing talks, and get some work done ‚úçÔ∏èüíªüìñ.

June 2024 - I gave a [talk](UPF-BSC_talk.pdf) at University of Pompeu Fabra and Barcelona Supercomputing centre on June 26 and 28. 

May 2024 - Our CogSci 2024 paper won the Computational Modeling Prize in Perception & Action! In July, I presented this work as a [poster](hils_poster.pdf) at [HILS](https://hils2024.nl/) and as a talk at CogSci (this time my visa got sorted!).

January 2024 - I will be visiting [Naomi Feldman](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/) at the University of Maryland College Park between March and May (April update: my visa didn't come through in time).
