## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hi! I'm Oli, a 2nd year PhD student in the [CDT for Natural language processing](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing) at the University of Edinburgh. I work with [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/) on computational modeling for phonetic acquisition and speech perception.

Before coming to Edinburgh, I did an MEng in information engineering and a MPhil in computer science at the University of Cambridge, where I spent time in Emmanuel and Christ's College.
