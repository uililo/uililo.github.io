## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hi! I'm Oli, a second year PhD student in the [CDT in Natural language processing](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing) at the University of Edinburgh. I work with [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/) and [Hao Tang](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/htang2/) on computational modeling for phonetic acquisition and speech perception.

Before coming to the amazing Edinburgh, I did an BA & MEng in information engineering followed by an MPhil in computer science at the University of Cambridge, where I was a member of Emmanuel and Christ's College. I also spent one year at the University of Hong Kong as part of the fourth cohort of the HKU-Cambridge joint recruitment scheme before coming to the UK.

I come from [Guizhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizhou), China. In my spare time, I enjoy curling up with a book and hanging out with my three cats. I procrastinate (a lot) by singing to my guitar(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1SM4y1a7mB/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=e3f631721911b234a344fec9c1426dfb).
