## About me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg" onmouseover="this.src='coco_headphone.jpg';" onmouseout="this.src='profile.jpg';">

Hi! I'm a PhD student in the [CDT in Natural language processing](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing) at the University of Edinburgh, where I work with [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/) and [Hao Tang](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/htang2/). In my research, I study *how* self-supervised speech representations encode [speaker](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12464.pdf) or about [neighboring phones](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08237), and whether they can shed light on humans process speech. More generally, I am interested in how humans and models acquire and process language. 

Email me (oli.liu) here: ed.ac.uk to talk about my research or Edinburgh or speech or NLP or cognitive science :) 

### News

May 2024 - Our CogSci 2024 paper won the Computational Modeling Prize in Perception & Action! In July, I will be presenting this work as a poster at [HILS](https://hils2024.nl/) and as a talk at CogSci (this time my visa got sorted).
